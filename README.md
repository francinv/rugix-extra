# Rugpi Extra

**Additional recipes and layers for [Rugpi](https://rugpi.io).**

To make the recipes and layers available, include the following in your `rugpi-bakery.toml`:

```toml
[repositories]
rugpi-extra = { git = "https://github.com/silitics/rugpi-extra.git", branch = "v0.6" }
```

We follow [Cargo's flavor of semantic versioning](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#semver-compatibility).
You can also use the most recent development version by omitting the `branch` property.
Please be aware that this may break your builds if we introduce backwards-incompatible changes.

## üôå Contributions

We accept pull requests adding additional recipes to `rugpi-extra` under the condition that these recipes are sufficiently general and widely applicable.
Please do not submit recipes for your own specific applications.
For those, you should create a separate repository yourself.
If you are unsure, feel free to open an issue.
